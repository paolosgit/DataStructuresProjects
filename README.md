# DataStructuresProjects
A single project folder of several graphical C++ applications for my data structures class.

In this repository, there are about five applications, a drop-menu, a menu bar, a text input box, an auto correct suggestion sorter, and a file tree.

(An auto correct suggestion sorter is a list of a words, given a .txt file, that are sorted given what is typed in a text input box)

All of these C++ applications are made with SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library). 

Project Highlights:
  -One thing that makes the auto correct interesting is that it utilizes a heap data structure in order to sort the words given the characters that are typed
    (The heap is also my own implementation that is in a separate project folder, but it will also be included in this repository!)
    
  -The file tree is a representation of a N-ary tree.
  
  To view a demonstration of there applications (minus a drop down menu because it's really just a single column of a menu bar), please follow
